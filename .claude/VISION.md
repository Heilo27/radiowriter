# VISION.md — Motorola CPS

> Project vision and user intent captured by the Pantheon team.

---

## Core Purpose

Reverse engineering Motorola CPS for interoperability research — understanding how radio programming works at the protocol level.

---

## Approach

- **Educational focus** — Learning and documentation, not circumvention
- **Evidence-based** — All findings backed by hex dumps, traces, analysis
- **Reproducible** — Document tools and steps so others can verify
- **Open knowledge** — Protocol documentation benefits the ham/two-way radio community

---

## Priorities

1. Understanding over speed
2. Documentation over implementation
3. Accuracy over completeness
4. Interoperability over feature parity

---

## Out of Scope

- Bypassing license protection
- Distributing proprietary binaries
- Enabling unauthorized radio modifications
- Anything that violates FCC regulations

---

## Decisions Log

_Decisions made during the project that clarify direction._

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-01-28 | Project initialized with Pantheon | Enable agent team for RE research |

## Open Questions

- Which radio families to prioritize?
- What level of detail needed for USB protocol?
- Build macOS-native tools or cross-platform Python?
