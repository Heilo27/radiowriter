## Description

**Source:** Daedalus Domain Assessment

**Problem:** Must open sheet to edit any channel property. Industry standard is inline editing or property inspector for quick changes.

**File:** ZoneChannelView.swift - ChannelEditorSheet (lines 940-1115)

**Industry Standard:** CHIRP uses spreadsheet-like inline editing. CPS 2.0 uses property inspector panel.

**Requirements:**
- Allow editing common fields directly in channel detail panel (right pane)
- Editable fields: name, RX/TX frequency, power, color code, timeslot
- Keep full editor sheet for advanced options
- Consider double-click to edit inline
- Tab between editable fields

**Priority:** High - reduces friction for common edits
