# TASK-081: [CRITICAL] GPL-2.0 license compliance - xcmp-xnl-dissector

**Status:** Done
**Priority:** Critical
**Assignee:** Themis
**Created:** 2026-02-05
**Updated:** 2026-02-06

## Description

**Source:** Themis Legal/Compliance Review

**Problem:** The project included `xcmp-xnl-dissector/` which is licensed under GPL-2.0. GPL-2.0 is a copyleft license that may have implications for the project's licensing.

**Resolution:** Option A selected — directory removed from repo, referenced externally only. Full audit confirms no derivative code exists.

---

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Audit completed: Identify any code derived from xcmp-xnl-dissector
- [x] Decision documented on how to handle the GPL-2.0 component
- [x] If removing: Remove from repo and update documentation to cite externally
- [x] LICENSE file created at project root stating project license
- [x] LEGAL.md updated with third-party license acknowledgments

---

## Context

**Why this matters:**
GPL-2.0 copyleft could require the entire project to be relicensed under GPL-2.0 if any code was derived from the dissector. This would conflict with the MIT license chosen for the project.

**Related:**
- TASK-101 (duplicate, completed 2026-02-05)
- `docs/GPL_COMPLIANCE_AUDIT.md` — full audit report

## Agent Notes

**2026-02-06 — Themis Final Review:**

This task duplicates TASK-101 (completed 2026-02-05). All substantive work verified complete:

1. **GPL Compliance Audit:** Documented in `docs/GPL_COMPLIANCE_AUDIT.md` — Finding: LOW RISK, reference material only
2. **Derivation Analysis:** Swift implementation independently developed from CPS packet captures and Moto.Net (MIT). No code copied from GPL-2.0 Lua dissector.
3. **Directory Removed:** `xcmp-xnl-dissector/` confirmed absent from repository
4. **LICENSE:** MIT License at project root with additional disclaimers
5. **LEGAL.md:** Comprehensive legal framework with clean-room methodology, DMCA 1201(f) basis, third-party acknowledgments
6. **Documentation Updated:** Fixed stale local path references in `docs/README.md` and `docs/RESEARCH_SUMMARY.md` to reference dissector as external GitHub resource only

**Decision:** Option A — Remove from repo, cite externally. Implemented and verified.
