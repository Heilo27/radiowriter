## Description

**Source:** Clio Documentation Review (TASK-111) + Friday request

Create a standalone CONTRIBUTING.md that makes it easy and safe for contributors to participate in this reverse engineering project.

**Must Include:**
- Development environment setup (Xcode, Swift, hardware requirements)
- Clean-room practices summary (reference LEGAL.md sections 235-268 for full details)
- Approved information sources list
- How to document findings (use patterns from PROJECT-CONTEXT.md)
- Code contribution workflow (branch, PR, review)
- Documentation contribution guidelines
- What NOT to contribute (proprietary code, keys, etc.)
- How to report security findings (responsible disclosure)
- Coding conventions (Swift style, naming, etc.)
- Source attribution requirements ("Observed via Wireshark" etc.)

**Key Constraint:** LEGAL.md already has excellent clean-room contributor requirements. CONTRIBUTING.md should be the friendly, practical version that references LEGAL.md for the formal requirements.
