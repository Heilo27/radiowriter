## Description

**Source:** Daedalus Domain Assessment

**Problem:** Fleet managers need to bulk-edit in Excel. Amateur operators need RepeaterBook import. No import/export functionality exists.

**Industry Standard:** EVERY professional CPS offers CSV import/export. CHIRP's killer feature is one-click RepeaterBook import.

**Requirements:**
- Export channels to CSV (name, frequencies, mode, color code, timeslot, contact, etc.)
- Export contacts to CSV (name, DMR ID, type)
- Import channels from CSV with field mapping
- Import contacts from CSV
- Use format compatible with CHIRP or CPS where possible
- Show import preview with validation before committing

**Priority:** High - blocks fleet management and amateur adoption
