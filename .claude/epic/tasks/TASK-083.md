## Description

**Source:** Themis Legal/Compliance Review

**Problem:** The application lacks Terms of Service (ToS) that users must acknowledge. Given the nature of this software (radio programming), ToS is essential to:
- Limit liability for radio misconfiguration
- Require users to comply with FCC/regulatory requirements
- Establish acceptable use policies
- Protect against misuse claims

**Required Terms:**

1. **Acceptance of Terms** - Users accept by using the software
2. **Description of Service** - What the software does
3. **User Responsibilities:**
   - Compliance with FCC regulations (Part 90, 95, 97 as applicable)
   - Proper licensing for radio operation
   - Responsibility for codeplug contents
   - Backup responsibility
4. **Restrictions:**
   - No use for illegal radio operations
   - No interference with licensed services
   - No circumventing radio security features maliciously
5. **Disclaimers:**
   - No guarantee of compatibility with all radios
   - No warranty for radio operation
   - Not responsible for FCC violations
6. **Limitation of Liability** - Standard AS-IS disclaimer
7. **Intellectual Property** - Motorola trademarks, third-party code
8. **Modifications** - Right to update ToS
9. **Governing Law** - Jurisdiction for disputes
