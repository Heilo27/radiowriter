## Description

**Source:** Themis Legal/Compliance Review

**Problem:** The Security Model document (docs/SECURITY.md) references a future privacy policy that now exists:
> "See also: Future privacy policy in preparation for distribution."

This needs updating since the privacy policy has been created.

**Additional Updates Needed:**

1. **Update reference to privacy policy** - Link to PRIVACY_POLICY.md
2. **Add section on encryption key handling** - Document that authentication keys are stored in source code and why
3. **Document data at rest** - Codeplug files on disk
4. **Document data in transit** - XNL/XCMP protocol security
5. **Add threat model for codeplug data** - Sensitive frequency/encryption info

**Current Strengths:**
- Clear network model explanation
- Good threat model for in-scope/out-of-scope
- Practical recommendations for users
- Honest about plaintext TCP limitations
