# TASK-082: [HIGH] Create project LICENSE file with appropriate licensing

**Status:** Done

## Description

**Source:** Themis Legal/Compliance Review

**Problem:** The project root lacks a LICENSE file declaring the project's license terms. Without explicit licensing, all rights are reserved by default, which:
- Prevents legitimate use by others
- Creates uncertainty about contribution terms
- Doesn't align with stated open-source intentions (Privacy Policy mentions "RadioWriter is free and open source software")

**Privacy Policy Claim:**
> "RadioWriter is free and open source software. You can review the source code to verify these privacy claims."

This claim requires an actual open-source license.

**Recommended Options:**

1. **MIT License** - Simple, permissive, compatible with Apache-2.0 (Moto.Net)
2. **Apache-2.0** - Matches Moto.Net, includes patent grant
3. **GPL-2.0** - If deriving from xcmp-xnl-dissector, may be required

**Decision Criteria:**
- If clean-room (no GPL derivation): MIT or Apache-2.0 recommended
- If GPL-derived code exists: Must use GPL-2.0
- Consider: Patent exposure for encryption implementations

## Agent Notes

### Analysis (2026-02-09, Themis)

**License Selection: MIT**

The LICENSE file already existed at the project root with MIT License (Copyright 2026 HeiloProjects), including additional disclaimers referencing LEGAL.md. This was the correct choice based on:

1. **GPL Compliance Audit** (`docs/GPL_COMPLIANCE_AUDIT.md`): Confirms no GPL-licensed code is incorporated. The xcmp-xnl-dissector (GPL-2.0) was used as reference only, has been removed from the repo, and the Swift implementation is independently developed. No derivative work.

2. **Third-party compatibility**:
   - Moto.Net: Apache-2.0 (compatible with MIT)
   - codeplug: MIT (same license)
   - xcmp-xnl-dissector: GPL-2.0 (external reference only, no code derived)

3. **Patent consideration**: MIT does not include an explicit patent grant (unlike Apache-2.0). However, given the project is an interoperability tool and the encryption implementations are based on publicly documented algorithms (TEA variant), the patent exposure is minimal. The LEGAL.md already includes comprehensive disclaimers.

4. **Privacy Policy validation**: The Privacy Policy states "RadioWriter is free and open source software." MIT License is OSI-approved, satisfying this claim. Updated Privacy Policy to directly reference the LICENSE file.

**Changes made:**
- Added License section to LEGAL.md with cross-reference to LICENSE file
- Documented source file header decision in LEGAL.md (omitted; MIT doesn't require them)
- Added License section to docs/README.md with third-party license table
- Updated docs/PRIVACY_POLICY.md to reference LICENSE and LEGAL.md directly
