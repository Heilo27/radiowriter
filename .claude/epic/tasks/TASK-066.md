## Description

**Source:** Daedalus Domain Assessment

**Problem:** Every professional MUST backup before making changes. No file save dialog, no explicit backup workflow. Risk of unrecoverable data loss.

**Industry Standard:** CPS 2.0 prompts to backup before any write operation. Clone Express is heavily used for fleet management.

**Requirements:**
- Add "Save As" with automatic timestamped backup
- Add "Backup Before Write" prompt
- Store backups in known location with radio serial number
- Show backup history for easy restore

**Files:** ContentView.swift:161-165 (Clone button is empty placeholder)

**Priority:** Critical - blocks professional adoption
