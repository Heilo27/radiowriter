# TASK-091: Add integration tests for read/write workflows

**Status:** Pending
**Priority:** Medium
**Assignee:** Unassigned

## Description

No integration tests exist for end-to-end radio programming workflows. Add tests using mock radio connections to verify complete read/write/validate cycles.

**Current State:**
- Unit tests cover individual components
- MockConnectionTests exists but limited
- No full workflow coverage

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create IntegrationTests target
- [ ] Test: Read codeplug from mock radio → Validate → Display
- [ ] Test: Edit codeplug → Validate → Write to mock radio → Read back → Verify
- [ ] Test: Import CSV → Merge into codeplug → Validate
- [ ] Test: Clone radio → Compare with original
- [ ] Test: Write failure recovery (partial write, retry)
- [ ] All tests use mock connections (no real hardware required)

---

## Context

**Why this matters:**
Integration tests catch issues at component boundaries that unit tests miss. Critical for radio programming where data flows through multiple layers (UI → Validator → Serializer → Programmer → USB).
