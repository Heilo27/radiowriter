## Description

**Source:** Themis Legal/Compliance Review

**Problem:** The project lacks a formal legal disclaimer document that establishes the legal basis for this reverse engineering work. Without proper documentation, the project faces significant legal risk under DMCA and related laws.

**Required Elements:**

1. **Interoperability Purpose Statement** - Explicit statement that this work is conducted under DMCA Section 1201(f) (US) and EU Directive 2009/24/EC which permit reverse engineering for interoperability purposes
2. **Clean-Room Methodology Documentation** - Document the separation between analysis and implementation
3. **Trademark Disclaimer** - Clear statement that MOTOTRBO, Motorola, and related marks are trademarks of Motorola Solutions, Inc.
4. **Non-Affiliation Disclaimer** - Explicit statement that this project is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Motorola Solutions
5. **Regulatory Compliance Warning** - Users must acknowledge responsibility for compliance with FCC Part 95, Part 90, and applicable radio regulations
6. **Encryption Key Usage Disclaimer** - Note that extracted encryption keys are documented solely for interoperability purposes
7. **No Warranty and Limitation of Liability** - Standard AS-IS disclaimer
8. **Contribution Guidelines** - Guidelines for contributors regarding clean-room requirements

**Location:** Create `/Users/home/Documents/Development/MotorolaCPS/LEGAL.md`
