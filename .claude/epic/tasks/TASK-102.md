- [ ] License header added to source files (or decision documented to omit) - Deferred
- [ ] README.md updated with license badge/statement - Separate task

## Resolution Notes

**Completed:** 2026-02-05 by Zeus

**License Chosen:** MIT License

**Rationale:**
- TASK-101 confirmed clean-room implementation (no GPL derivation required)
- Compatible with Moto.Net (MIT) and codeplug (MIT)
- Simple, permissive, and widely understood
- Aligns with Privacy Policy claim: "RadioWriter is free and open source software"

**File Created:** `/Users/home/Documents/Development/MotorolaCPS/LICENSE`
- Standard MIT License text
- Additional disclaimers section referencing LEGAL.md
- Trademark disclaimer for MOTOTRBO/Motorola

**Remaining:**
- License headers in source files (optional, can be deferred)
- README.md badge (separate task or manual)
