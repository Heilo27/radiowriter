## Description

**Source:** Code Review 2026-02-02 (Aegis)
**Severity:** Critical
**Category:** Quality

**Location:** RadioDetector.swift:940, 959 (isXNLPortOpen method)

**Issue:**
```swift
let port = NWEndpoint.Port(rawValue: 8002)!  // Force unwrap!
```

**Impact:** Will crash if port validation fails (theoretically impossible but defensive programming is critical for RE work).

**Recommendation:**
Use guard-let pattern:
```swift
guard let port = NWEndpoint.Port(rawValue: 8002) else {
    return false
}
```
