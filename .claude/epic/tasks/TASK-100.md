## Description

**Source:** Themis Legal/Compliance Review

**Problem:** The project lacks a formal legal disclaimer document that establishes the legal basis for this reverse engineering work. Without proper documentation, the project faces significant legal risk under DMCA and related laws.

**Required Elements:**

1. **Interoperability Purpose Statement** - Explicit statement that this work is conducted under DMCA Section 1201(f) (US) and EU Directive 2009/24/EC which permit reverse engineering for interoperability purposes
2. **Clean-Room Methodology Documentation** - Document the separation between analysis and implementation
3. **Trademark Disclaimer** - Clear statement that MOTOTRBO, Motorola, and related marks are trademarks of Motorola Solutions, Inc.
4. **Non-Affiliation Disclaimer** - Explicit statement that this project is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Motorola Solutions
5. **Regulatory Compliance Warning** - Users must acknowledge responsibility for compliance with FCC Part 95, Part 90, and applicable radio regulations
6. **Encryption Key Usage Disclaimer** - Note that extracted encryption keys are documented solely for interoperability purposes
7. **No Warranty and Limitation of Liability** - Standard AS-IS disclaimer
8. **Contribution Guidelines** - Guidelines for contributors regarding clean-room requirements

**Location:** Create `/Users/home/Documents/Development/MotorolaCPS/LEGAL.md`

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] LEGAL.md file created at project root
- [x] All eight required elements are addressed
- [x] Document is written in plain language (not just legalese)
- [x] Cross-references to applicable statutes included
- [ ] README.md updated to reference LEGAL.md
- [ ] CLAUDE.md Privacy & Legal section updated to reference LEGAL.md

---

## Context

**Why this matters:**
Reverse engineering projects face heightened legal scrutiny. The DMCA and similar laws in other jurisdictions provide exceptions for interoperability, but these exceptions require proper documentation of purpose and methodology. Without this documentation, the project could face:
- DMCA anti-circumvention claims
- Trade secret misappropriation claims
- Trademark infringement claims
- Contributor liability exposure

**Related:**
- docs/README.md (Legal and Ethical Notes section)
- CLAUDE.md (Privacy & Legal section)
- Previous review: docs/reviews/review-2026-02-02-full-team.md (S2)

2. **Legal Basis** - DMCA Section 1201(f), EU Directive 2009/24/EC, plus references to Australia, Canada, Japan, UK statutes
3. **Clean-Room Methodology** - Documents information sources (open-source projects, network analysis, published docs) and explicitly states what is NOT included
4. **Trademark Disclaimers** - MOTOTRBO, Motorola, XPR, and Apple trademarks properly attributed
5. **Non-Affiliation Statement** - Clear statement of independence from Motorola Solutions
6. **No Proprietary Code** - Explicit statement that no Motorola code, DLLs, or encryption constants are included
7. **Warranty Disclaimer** - Full AS-IS warranty disclaimer with specific warnings about radio equipment, regulatory compliance, and data loss
8. **Contributing Guidelines** - Clean-room requirements for contributors
