## Description

**Source:** Themis Legal/Compliance Review

**Problem:** The existing Privacy Policy (docs/PRIVACY_POLICY.md) is well-written but lacks specific contact information. The current "Contact" section only says:
- "Review the source code"
- "Submit issues via the project repository"

**Issues:**
1. No repository URL provided
2. No email contact for privacy inquiries
3. No physical address (may be required in some jurisdictions)
4. No data protection officer information (if applicable)

**Required Updates:**

1. Add project repository URL
2. Add contact email (or GitHub Issues link)
3. Consider GDPR requirements if targeting EU users:
   - Data controller identification
   - DPO contact (if applicable)
   - Supervisory authority reference
4. Update "Last Updated" date after changes

**Current Privacy Policy Strengths:**
- Clear data collection statements (collects nothing)
- Network connectivity explanation
- Third-party services section
- Children's privacy section

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Repository URL added to Contact section
- [ ] Email contact or Issues link added
- [ ] GDPR considerations evaluated and addressed if needed
- [ ] "Last Updated" date updated
- [ ] Privacy Policy reviewed for accuracy against current implementation

---

## Context

**Why this matters:**
Privacy policies should provide clear contact mechanisms for users with privacy questions. Even though this app collects no data, users should be able to reach out with questions.
