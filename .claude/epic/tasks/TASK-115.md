## Description

**Source:** Clio Documentation Review (TASK-111)

The project has no root README.md. This is the most critical documentation gap - it's the first thing any visitor sees.

**Must Include:**
- Project name and one-line description
- Purpose statement (interoperability research for MOTOTRBO radios)
- Architecture overview (package structure diagram)
- Build instructions (Xcode, Swift version, dependencies)
- Quick start guide (connect radio, read codeplug)
- Supported radio families and status
- Link to protocol documentation (docs/README.md)
- Link to LEGAL.md and LICENSE
- Link to CONTRIBUTING.md (once created)
- Non-affiliation disclaimer

**Reference:** See docs/README.md for protocol docs index style. See LEGAL.md for proper disclaimer language.
