## Description

**Source:** Themis Legal/Compliance Review

**Problem:** The repository contains extracted Motorola CPS application files that should not be distributed:

**Locations:**
- `analysis/extracted_app/` - Full extracted CPS application
- `analysis/data1.hdr` and `analysis/data2.cab` - Installation archives
- `Binaries/` directory - May contain proprietary binaries

**Legal Issues:**

1. **Copyright Infringement** - Distributing Motorola proprietary software
2. **DMCA Violation** - Circumvention tools or results
3. **Trade Secret Exposure** - DLLs may contain trade secrets
4. **License Violation** - Motorola CPS requires license agreement

**Recommended Actions:**

1. **Remove extracted_app/** directory entirely
2. **Remove installer archives** (data1.hdr, data2.cab)
3. **Audit Binaries/** directory and remove proprietary content
4. **Add to .gitignore** to prevent future commits
5. **Document what to download** instead (if users need CPS for testing)

**Keep:**
- Documentation of findings (hex dumps, protocol specs)
- Analysis notes that don't include copyrighted code
- References to where binaries can be obtained legally

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `analysis/extracted_app/` removed from repository
- [ ] Installation archives removed
- [ ] `Binaries/` audited and cleaned
- [ ] `.gitignore` updated to prevent re-addition
- [ ] Git history cleaned (optional but recommended: `git filter-branch` or BFG)
- [ ] README updated with instructions for obtaining CPS legally

---

## Context

**Why this matters:**
Distributing proprietary software without authorization is:
- Copyright infringement
- Potentially criminal (especially with circumvention)
- Grounds for DMCA takedown of entire repository

The analysis documentation is valuable; the actual binaries are a liability.
