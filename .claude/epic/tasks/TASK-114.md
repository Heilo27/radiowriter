## Description

**Source:** Zeus Multi-Domain Review Coordination

**Problem:** If the RadioWriter application is intended for distribution, market positioning should be assessed:

1. **Competitive Landscape**
   - Official Motorola CPS (Windows-only)
   - CHIRP (open-source, limited radio support)
   - Other third-party tools
   - Commercial alternatives

2. **Target Users**
   - Ham radio operators
   - Commercial fleet managers
   - Public safety agencies
   - Technical enthusiasts

3. **Feature Gaps**
   - What does Motorola CPS do that RadioWriter doesn't?
   - What does RadioWriter do better (macOS native)?
   - Missing radio model support

4. **Differentiation**
   - macOS native (no Windows needed)
   - Open-source protocol documentation
   - Privacy-focused (no telemetry)
   - Modern UI vs legacy Windows app

5. **Distribution Considerations**
   - Open source vs closed source
   - App Store vs direct download
   - License implications
