## Description

**Source:** Clio Documentation Review (TASK-111)

XCMP protocol information is duplicated across analysis/ and docs/ directories, causing confusion about which is canonical.

**Overlapping Areas:**
- XCMP opcodes: `analysis/XCMP_OPCODES.md` vs opcodes in `docs/protocols/XCMP_XNL_PROTOCOL.md`
- Command details: `analysis/XCMP_COMMAND_DETAILS.md` vs `docs/protocols/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`
- Protocol overview: `analysis/protocols/XCMP-Command-Reference.md` vs `docs/QUICK_REFERENCE.md`

**Proposed Solution:**
- `docs/` = Canonical, polished documentation (for readers)
- `analysis/` = Raw research notes and findings (for researchers)
- Add clear cross-references between related docs
- Add "canonical version" notes where content overlaps

**Also Fix:**
- Port discrepancy: Whitepaper says TCP:8002, Quick Reference says UDP:4002. Both may be valid (different modes) but needs explicit clarification.
- Update blocker status: Several docs still list encryption constants as "critical blocker" but implementation has progressed beyond this.
