# TASK-078: Memory leak - observationTask never cleaned up

**Status:** Done
**Priority:** Critical

## Description

`AppCoordinator` stores `observationTask` but never cancels it in `deinit`. The Task holds `[weak self]` but continues running indefinitely, checking every 500ms. This creates a memory leak and wastes CPU cycles.

**Current Impact:**
- Background task runs forever, even after coordinator is deallocated
- CPU usage continues when app should be idle
- Multiple coordinators over app lifetime = multiple runaway tasks

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Add `deinit` to `AppCoordinator` that cancels `observationTask`
- [ ] Verify task terminates when coordinator is deallocated
- [ ] No CPU usage when app is idle (confirmed with Activity Monitor)
- [ ] Memory leak validated with Instruments (Leaks + Allocations)
