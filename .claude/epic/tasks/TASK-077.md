## Description

`CodeplugSerializer.compress()` and `decompress()` use synchronous `compression_encode_buffer` which blocks the calling thread. This can freeze the UI during large codeplug save/load operations (typical size: several MB).

**Current Impact:**
- 2-5 second UI freeze when saving large codeplugs
- Main thread blocked during file I/O operations
- Poor user experience on slower Macs

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Compression/decompression runs on background queue
- [ ] UI remains responsive during codeplug save/load
- [ ] Progress indicator works correctly during async operation
- [ ] File operations complete successfully without data corruption
- [ ] Performance improvement measured with Instruments
