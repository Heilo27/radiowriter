## Description

**Source:** Clio Documentation Review (TASK-111)

No DocC catalogs exist. The project has 1,831 public declarations across 58 source files with only ~15-20% documentation coverage.

**Scope:**
1. Create `.docc` catalog for RadioCore (172 public declarations)
   - Codeplug, FieldDefinition, FieldValue, BinaryPacker/Unpacker
2. Create `.docc` catalog for RadioModels (1,060 public declarations)
   - RadioModel protocol, ParsedCodeplug, FrequencyBand, RadioFamily
3. Create `.docc` catalog for RadioHardware (586 public declarations)
   - RadioProgrammer, RadioDetector, USBConnection, XCMPProtocol

**Priority Files for Inline Documentation:**
- ParsedCodeplug.swift (164 public properties, ~15% documented)
- XCMPProtocol.swift (241 public declarations, ~20% documented)
- LTEProtocol.swift (104 public declarations, ~25% documented)

**Note:** This is a large effort. Consider starting with module-level overview articles and documenting the most critical types first.
