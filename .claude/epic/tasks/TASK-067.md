## Description

**Source:** Daedalus Domain Assessment

**Problem:** No validation before writing to radio. Invalid configurations could brick a radio or cause RF interference.

**Industry Standard:** CPS 2.0 validates entire codeplug before programming, shows error/warning list.

**Requirements:**
- Validate all required fields are populated
- Check for duplicate channel/zone names
- Validate frequency ranges against radio band limits
- Check for orphaned references (deleted contacts still referenced)
- Check DMR ID validity (1-16777215 range)
- Display error/warning list before allowing write
- Block write if critical errors exist

**Priority:** Critical - risk of invalid radio configuration
