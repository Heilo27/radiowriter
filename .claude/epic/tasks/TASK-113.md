## Description

**Source:** Zeus Multi-Domain Review Coordination

**Problem:** Knowledge capture and pattern documentation needs review:

1. **Reusable Patterns**
   - Binary parsing patterns
   - Protocol implementation patterns
   - SwiftUI component patterns
   - Error handling patterns

2. **Lessons Learned**
   - Reverse engineering methodology
   - Protocol discovery process
   - Tool limitations discovered
   - Workarounds documented

3. **Knowledge Capture**
   - Protocol findings in knowledge base
