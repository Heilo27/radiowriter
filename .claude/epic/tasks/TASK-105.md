## Description

**Source:** Themis Legal/Compliance Review

**Problem:** Apache-2.0 (Moto.Net) requires a NOTICE file be preserved and reproduced. MIT license (codeplug) requires copyright notice preservation. The project needs proper attribution.

**Third-Party Components:**

| Component | Path | License | Attribution Required |
|-----------|------|---------|---------------------|
| Moto.Net | `Moto.Net/` | Apache-2.0 | Yes - NOTICE file + license |
| xcmp-xnl-dissector | `xcmp-xnl-dissector/` | GPL-2.0 | Yes - full license + copyright |
| codeplug | `codeplug/` | MIT | Yes - copyright notice |
| Dojo (in extracted CPS) | `analysis/extracted_app/...` | Various | N/A - analysis artifacts |

**Required Actions:**

1. **Create NOTICE file** at project root with:
   - Project copyright
   - Third-party attributions
   - License references

2. **Create THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md** with full license texts or references

3. **Verify compliance:**
   - Apache-2.0: Check for NOTICE file in Moto.Net (if present, must preserve)
   - GPL-2.0: Must include full license text
   - MIT: Must include copyright notice
