- Create interference with licensed services

**Recommended Implementation:**

1. **First-run warning dialog:**

   - Reference FCC Parts 90, 95, 97 as applicable
   - Require acknowledgment before proceeding

2. **About screen:**
   - Include regulatory disclaimer
   - Link to FCC information resources

3. **Write confirmation:**
   - Before writing to radio, remind user of compliance responsibility
   - Optional "Don't show again" checkbox

**Sample Warning Text:**
```
IMPORTANT: Radio programming requires compliance with FCC regulations.

You are responsible for ensuring:
- You are authorized to operate on programmed frequencies
- Power levels comply with license class requirements  
- All transmissions comply with applicable regulations

Improper radio programming may violate federal law and cause harmful interference.
