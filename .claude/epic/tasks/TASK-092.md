**Status:** Pending
**Priority:** Low
**Assignee:** Unassigned
**Created:** 2026-02-05
**Updated:** 2026-02-05

## Description

No documentation exists for test strategy, coverage goals, or how to run tests. Create a testing guide for contributors.

**Current State:**
- Tests exist but no documentation
- No coverage metrics tracked
- No testing guide for new contributors

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create docs/testing/TEST-STRATEGY.md
- [ ] Document test pyramid (unit, integration, UI)
- [ ] Define coverage goals (80%+ for critical paths)
- [ ] List how to run tests (swift test, Xcode)
- [ ] Document mocking strategy for hardware
- [ ] Add test writing guidelines
- [ ] Document CI test execution (if applicable)

**Contents:**
```markdown
# Test Strategy

## Test Pyramid
- Unit: 70% (RadioCore, AudioEngine, RadioModels)
- Integration: 20% (RadioHardware workflows)
- UI: 10% (CPSApp critical paths)

## Coverage Goals
- Critical: 100% (binary packing, serialization, validation)
- Core: 80% (programmer protocols, USB transport)
- UI: 60% (views, coordinators)

## Running Tests

## Context

**Why this matters:**
Clear test strategy helps contributors know what tests to write and maintainers know what gaps exist.
