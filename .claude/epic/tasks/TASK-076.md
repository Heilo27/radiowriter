## Description

Consolidated two duplicate codeplug domain models into a single source of truth:

**Before:** Two parallel models existed:
1. `XPRCodeplug` in RadioModels/XPR — Rich @Observable class with Swift enums (completely unused)
2. `ParsedCodeplug` + `ChannelData` in RadioHardware/RadioProgrammer — Wire-level structs used by entire app

**After:** Single unified model in `RadioModels/RadioModelCore/ParsedCodeplug.swift`:
- `ParsedCodeplug`, `ChannelData`, `ParsedZone`, `ParsedContact`, `ParsedScanList`, `ParsedRxGroupList` and all supporting types
- Removed duplicate definitions from `MOTOTRBOProgrammer.swift` and `XCMPProtocol.swift`
- Deleted unused `XPRCodeplug.swift` entirely
- Updated all 10 app files and 2 hardware files with correct imports
- Build verified successful with zero errors

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Single source of truth for MOTOTRBO codeplug domain model
- [ ] Model lives in RadioModels package (where it belongs architecturally)
- [ ] MOTOTRBOProgrammer returns the unified model type
- [ ] App layer references single model type
- [ ] Remove redundant type definitions
