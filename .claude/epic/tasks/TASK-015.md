## Description

**Source:** Code Review 2026-02-02 (Aegis)
**Severity:** Critical
**Category:** Quality

**Location:** XNLConnection.swift:718-902 (sendXCMP method)

**Issues:**
1. No retry mechanism for transient network failures
2. No exponential backoff for repeated failures
3. Message ID overflow not handled (xnlMessageID is UInt8, wraps at 255)

**Impact:** Long programming sessions (>255 commands) may fail. Network hiccups cause immediate failure.

**Recommendation:**
- Add retry logic with exponential backoff (3 attempts, 100ms/500ms/2s delays)
- Handle UInt8 message ID wraparound explicitly
- Add maximum retry count to prevent infinite loops
- Log retry attempts for debugging
